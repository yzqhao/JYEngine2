Changes since the last public release (1.5.29):

  Added PNGMINUS_UNUSED macro to contrib/pngminus/p*.c and added missing
    parenthesis in contrib/pngminus/pnm2png.c (bug report by Christian Hesse).
  Fixed off-by-one error in png_do_check_palette_indexes() (Bug report
    by Mick P., Source Forge Issue #269).
  Compute a larger limit on IDAT because some applications write a deflate
    buffer for each row (Bug report by Andrew Church).
  Fixed incorrect typecast of some arguments to png_malloc() and
    png_calloc() that were png_uint_32 instead of png_alloc_size_t
    (Bug report by "irwir" in Github libpng issue #175).
  Initialize memory allocated by png_inflate to zero, using memset, to
    stop an oss-fuzz "use of uninitialized value" detection in png_set_text_2()
    due to truncated iTXt or zTXt chunk.
